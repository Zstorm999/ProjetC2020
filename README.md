# Projet C 2020

## Compiling the project
To compile the project, a makefile is provided, and should work without any problems. This project is designed for Linux (tested on Debian), and might not work on other operating systems.

## Libraries
No external libraries were used! You don't have to install anything, if you have the standard library installed the software should work just fine (I hope so)
