# Projet2020

All the libraries used in this project (aside of the standard C librarie) are in the ./libs directory
If the compilation isn't working, consider extracting the corresponding archive, and then performing the following commands:

cd ./libs/thelibyouwanttoinstall
make
su root
make install

or installing the librarie from the package manager (might not be the correct version though)
